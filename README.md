# Caffe Confusion Matrix

Generating a confusion matrix for my Caffe dataset.

## Note

This C++ code has been hacked together extremely quickly - paths and files are hardcoded in etc. I did this because I needed to generate the confusion matrix for my thesis to demonstrate the accuracy of my tag identification system.
